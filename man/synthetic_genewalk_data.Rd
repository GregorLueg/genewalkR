\title{Generate synthetic GeneWalk data}
\usage{
synthetic_genewalk_data(data_params = params_genewalk_data(), seed = 42L)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_params}{Named list. Return from
\code{\link[=params_genewalk_data]{params_genewalk_data()}}.}

\item{seed}{Integer. Random seed. Defaults to \code{42L}.}
}
\value{
A list with the following items:
\describe{
\item{full_data}{A data.table with columns \code{from} and \code{to} containing
all edges (ontology hierarchy, gene-to-pathway, and PPI).}
\item{gene_to_pathways}{A data.table with columns \code{from} (gene) and
\code{to} (pathway) for gene-to-ontology annotation edges only.}
\item{gene_ids}{Character vector of all gene identifiers (signal and
noise).}
\item{pathway_ids}{Character vector of all ontology term identifiers.}
}
}
\description{
Generates a synthetic network that mimics real GeneWalk input data for
testing and benchmarking. The network consists of three components: a
hierarchical ontology (tree structure with lateral edges), gene-to-ontology
annotations, and protein-protein interactions (PPI).

Signal genes are annotated exclusively within a single ontology subtree and
form PPI edges among themselves, creating coherent graph neighbourhoods.
Noise genes receive the same number of annotations but are forced to span
multiple subtrees, and their PPI edges are random across the noise group.
Both groups are degree-matched so that significance is driven by annotation
coherence rather than connectivity alone.
